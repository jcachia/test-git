Today we're testing GH actions.  This is a branch that I'll merge into both master and a non-master branch to see if the action I created is triggered. 

Oddly, this didnt trigger the other action I created when i pushed this branch.  Trying to push a commit to see if it triggers on that.... 

This is only a change in a feature branch to be merged to master, then hopefully it merges automatically to master-aux.  I wonder if there will be a merge conflict?

OK, yeah, that made a merge conflict.  It halted the merge in the action, so that's good.  This change should go in with no conflicts.
