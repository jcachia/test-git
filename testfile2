Here's another test file.

I merged OldBranch with master.  I'd like to see if the commit history stays with the merged branch.

Then, after i push this branch, OldBranch2, I will make a new branch locally and push it.  Then I will review the commits.

- I'd like to see all the commits in master from OldBranch; there were about 6.

- I'd like to see the commits in NewBranch2, moved from OldBranch2.
